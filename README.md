#Boarding Finder App

The Boarding Finder App is a mobile application planned to help students and working professionals find and manage accommodations. The app aims to provide an intuitive interface for browsing properties, applying search filters, and viewing details such as location, price, and amenities.

The frontend is planned to be developed using Flutter for a smooth, cross-platform mobile experience. The backend is planned with Node.js, which will handle user authentication, property management, and booking functionality.

Currently, the project is in progress, with features, design, and technical stack defined, but no actual implementation has been done yet.
